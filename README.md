# Weather Classification
A Machine Learning project to predict weather given many features of weather conditions using many Machine learning models. The project includes Exploratory Data analysis, data preprocessing, outlier processing, and comparison between various models used.

## Project Overview
This project was made to analyse different weather features and predict the weather on the basis of that. The project includes -

  1. Exploratory Data Analysis on the `WeatherClassification.csv` dataset.
  1. Data preprocessing and outlier handling on the dataset.
  1. Machine Learning model training using models like Naive Bayes', Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Random Forest Classification and Deep Learning.
  1. Comparison of the used ML models.
